    - KSA BBBS
5. E-Board Member Page / About Us Page
  - Displays everyone on e-board
  - Alumni Page??? (probably not, but we can still discuss later)

6. SHOULD WE INCLUDE AN ANNOUNCEMENT SECTION???
 
## Navigation bar:  
  Left-side, black bar where there will be navigation icons that will take the user to different parts of the webpage via smooth scroll  
  OR  
  Make the menu on the homepage smoothly transition into the navi bar on top as the user scrolls down  
  Similar to: https://www.actonglobal.com/
  use fa-fa ions!!!

## Points: 
1. Include facebook and youtube(Gilllink/embedding
2. Include a gallery
3. Make the whole website a continuous page where certain links will take the user to certain points of the webpage
4. Make sure to give credit for photos, code

# All files for the new website is in folder "NEW"

## UPDATES:

Included new super thin font
Included slide in animations

Need: 
  - BETTER PICTURES!!!!!
  - The event page looks kind of empty, but that might be okay
  - The layout and font of Culture Show page needs to modified
    
Problems:
  - Proper sizes for each page based on different screens
  - How to account for people making the webpage smaller, bigger, etc.  
     use: http://gijsroge.github.io/priority-nav.js/#
  - Home page picture is needed desperately!!! (First one was too blurry and this one is covering alot of the faces)
