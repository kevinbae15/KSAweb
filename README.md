# KSA WEB DEVELOPMENT

Design: Very clean modern design, MINIMALISTIC STYLE
*Open to any suggestions*


## One long webpage setup
1. Home Page
2. Events Page
  - Display three boxes with each type of event (Food, Open Meetings, and Social)
3. Culture Show Page
  - Slideshow gallery
4. Extra (thinking of a new name)  
  Highlights:  
    - Gajok system (family)
    - KSA BBBS
5. E-Board Member Page / About Us Page
  - Displays everyone on e-board
  - Alumni Page??? (probably not, but we can still discuss later)
  - Display our club message and goals
  
6. SHOULD WE INCLUDE AN ANNOUNCEMENT SECTION???
  - Combine with Events page?
  - Could make the event page look less empty and allow people come to most recent events
 
## Navigation bar:  
  Left-side, black bar where there will be navigation icons that will take the user to different parts of the webpage via smooth scroll  
  OR  
  Make the menu on the homepage smoothly transition into the navi bar on top as the user scrolls down  
  Similar to: https://www.actonglobal.com/  
  OR  
  Menu bottom on top left/right and clicking brings up all of the navi buttons which will be grey,black,etc.
  use fa-fa ions!!!

## Points: 
1. Include facebook and youtube(Gilleun) link/embedding
2. Include a gallery
3. Make the whole website a continuous page where certain links will take the user to certain points of the webpage
4. Make sure to give credit for photos, code
5. Mobile friendly!!!(We are going to address the issue of how to make ":hover" work on mobile devices)

# All files for the new website is in folder "NEW"

## UPDATES:

Included new super thin font
Included slide in animations

Need: 
  - BETTER PICTURES!!!!!
  - The event page looks kind of empty, but that might be okay
  - The layout and font of Culture Show page needs to modified
    
Problems:
  - Proper sizes for each page based on different screens  
  `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`
  - How to account for people making the webpage smaller, bigger, etc.  
     use: http://gijsroge.github.io/priority-nav.js/#
  - Home page picture is needed desperately!!! (First one was too blurry and this one is covering alot of the faces)
  - Website is little slow/choppy  
  use: http://learntocodewith.me/posts/make-your-website-fast/
