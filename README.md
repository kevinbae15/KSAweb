## UPDATES:

Included new font ("UNISANS")

Need: 
  - Logos on the homepage
  - .ico file for the icon on the tabs  
    `<head>`  
      `<link rel="shortcut icon" type="image/x-icon" href="example.ico" />`  
    `</head>`
    
Problems:
  - Proper sizes for each page based on different screens
  - How to account for people making the webpage smaller, bigger, etc.  
     use: http://gijsroge.github.io/priority-nav.js/#
  - Been only using % for sizes (is that bad or nah???)
